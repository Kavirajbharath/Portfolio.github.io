    <u><H1>Project Title</H1></u>
    <h3><p><q>Real Time Water Quality Monitoring System</q></p></h3>
    <p><blockquote><b>Water pollution</b> is one of the biggest fears for the <u>green globalization</u>. In 
        order to ensure the safe supply of the drinking water the quality needs to be 
        monitor in real time. In this project we present a design and development of a low 
        cost system for real time monitoring of the water quality in IOT (internet of things). 
        The polluted water can cause various diseases to <i>humans and animals</i>, which in 
        turn affects the life cycle of the ecosystem. If water pollution is detected in an early 
        stage, suitable measures can be avoided. To make certain the supply of pure water, 
        the quality of the water should be examined in real time. The system consist of 
        several sensors is used to measuring physical and chemical parameters of the 
        water. <mark> The parameters such as temperature, PH, turbidity, flow sensor of the water 
        can be measured</mark>. The measured values from the sensors can be processed by the 
        core controller. The Arduino/NodeMCU model can be used as a core controller. 
        Finally, the sensor data can be viewed on internet using WI-FI system.Using those 
        sensor output data we can use water for <u>irrigation, drinking,</u> and other purpose ie if 
        the water reaches the valid data range then the motor will ON and water will pump 
        through motor.</blockquote></p>

    <h3><p><blockquote><q>Hostel Management System</q></blockquote></p></h3>
        <p><blockquote>As in manual process of hostel management system the problems faced that is 
            difficulty in maintenances of records, there may be no security of data, it requires lack of 
            efficiency and man power, editing of data becomes a difficult job.. 
             Due to that, This project offer user to enter the data through simple and 
            interactive manner. User is provided the option of only view the records he entered earlier. 
            Data storage and retrieval will become faster and easier to maintain.</blockquote></p>
